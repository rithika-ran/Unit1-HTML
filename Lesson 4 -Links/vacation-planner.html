      <p>Bali is a provinance in Indonesia, known for it's <i>stunning</i> views,
         gorgeous beaches, and diverse foods. To learn more about the rich culture
        and harmonious lifestyle in Bali, I love using the 
        <a href="https://lovebali.baliprov.go.id/" target="_blank"> official Bali 
            tourism website </a> it has such <em> detailed</em> information, and answers questions I 
        didn't even think of! If you're intrested in more specific activies and events to look forward
    to on your next trip there, take a look at the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g294226-Bali-Vacations.html" target="_blank">TripAdvisor website,</a>
        where they have <i>everything,</i> from the best hotels, beaches, resturants, and experiences.
        I know I sure am. Another thing, you want to plan your trip accordinly to the weather. You don't 
    wanna go during a rainy week and forget your poncho, that'd be a <i>nightmare!</i> 
    I find that <a href="https://weather.com/weather/today/l/ed6821bd8cf3ad861528ee66546ca0573862c4e1678f1c85732fba7d3e5298f1" target="_blank">
        The Weather Channel </a> is super trustworthy!</p>

    <!-- Add h3 subheading "Transportation Info" -->
    <h3>Transportation Info</h3>
    <p>For easy local transportation, you can use the bus system; cheap and effective! 
        But, for longer distances, a private driver is recomended. Something else that is common in 
        Bali, are ride sharing apps like <a href="https://www.gojek.com/en-id" target="_blank">Gojeck</a>
         and <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/" target="_blank"> Grab. </a> Whatever you choose, its 
         always a good idea to have <a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank"> Google Maps</a>
on hand! </p>
