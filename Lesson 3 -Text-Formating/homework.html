    <h2>Welcome to My Page!
        <p> <header> About me:</header>Hi! If you couldn't already tell, my name is <b> 
            Rithika Ranjith.</b> I'm a <i> ninth grader </i> at Bergen Tech Teterboro, 
            in the Computer Science major. Some things about me, is I love hanging 
            out with my friends and family, watching shows, and making crafts in my 
            spare time.</p> </h2> <hr>
<h2> My Intrests: </h2>
<h3> <p><header> Favorite Hobby: </header> Something I <strong> truely </strong> enjoy doing, is playing the <em> viola </em> 
    (which, by the way is <i>much</i> better than the violin.) I started in 4th grade, and have
been playing since. Usually, in an <strong> orchestra</strong>, violas are 
assigned the <em> harmony.</em> Our notes and strings are a little 
deeper than the violin's, making us <em>perfect</em> for the job. My favorite part
about playing in an orchestra is simply being able to spend time with my <strong> 
    friends.</strong></p>

<p2><header>Other Interests: </header>Like I might've mentioned eariler, I enjoy doing <i>
     small crafts </i>in my spare time. In the past, i've made <u><b>poster</b></u> sized <em>
         diamond art</em> pictures. More recently, I love making <strong> beaded bracelets,
             </strong> though at times, it definitely can get <i> frustrating</i>, specially when
              i'm <b>so </b> close to finishing on, and it <u>all</u> falls out onto the <b>floor.</b>Nonetheless, it's still pretty enjoyable, and you get a <em>cute</em> 
                piece of jewlery after! </p2></h3>
